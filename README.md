# DND-NPC-Generator
A webapp that randomly creates DND non-player characters for spontaneous generation.

This simple app creates a variety of information for Dungeons and Dragons characters. It is a useful tool
while playing with friends since it helps create new characters on the fly.

This app was an experiment in JavaScript and interactive webpages, and it resulted in a small, fun, and useful 
app.
